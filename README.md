# Example Todo List with Hooks

## Overview
This example uses the React Hooks as a means to manage state for a simple Todo list.  The Hook that is employed in this example is `useReducer` and is based loosely on the [Redux Todo List](https://redux.js.org/basics/example) example.  This application uses the [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) also referred to as CRA.
